Java SSST-Analytics
===================
by Wacholski Konrad

SSST-Analytics (digital forensic application) gives criminal investigators the opportunity to analyze all of the
collected social network data, which are successfully captured by a required application, with the aim to use 
this information as evidence for digital crimes. This application is based on an external application, 
called “social snapshot”. The main function of the social snapshot application is to capture social network datasets 
(this project will focus purely on capturing Facebook data), which contains pro?le information – like user data, photos,
private messages etc - and associated meta-data - like internal timestamps and unique identi?ers. Due to the diversity 
of the possible ways to analyze this social network account information, SSST-Analytics focuses on traditional
forensic data analysis and image matching or rather digital image forensics.

        "java -jar SSST_Analytics.jar *JSON_directory* complete" (all forensic analyses)
        "java -jar SSST_Analytics.jar *JSON_directory* data      (only data analysis)
        "java -jar SSST_Analytics.jar *JSON_directory* image     (only image analysis)
